## Project Overview

<!-- One-paragraph description of what this project is. -->

> Keep this root file lean. It loads into every agent turn — verbose doctrine
> buries the rules the model must follow (signal dilution). Route per-file and
> task-specific detail into the directory `AGENTS.md` tree and `docs/`; keep
> only always-on doctrine here.

## Code Instructions

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common coding mistakes. Bias toward caution over
speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

### 1. Think Before Coding

- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- Never speculate about code you have not opened. Consult the doc tree
  (`kb agents <path>` / `kb_search`) first, then read the specific file.
- Before any major change, confirm the plan.

See the **Finding docs (READ discipline)** section for the kb-first
substitution table (which `kb_*` call replaces which raw-search reflex).

### 2. Simplicity First

- Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.
- No features beyond what was asked; no abstractions for single-use code.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- DRY: extract a shared helper when a pattern repeats; don't pre-extract for one call site.

### 3. Surgical Changes

- Touch only what you must. Match existing style.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Remove imports/variables your changes made unused; leave pre-existing dead code (mention it).
- Every changed line traces directly to the request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution (TDD)

- Turn tasks into verifiable goals with explicit success criteria.
- Write or update tests first, verify they fail, then write the minimal implementation to pass.
- For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan with a verify step each.

### 5. Communication

- Give a high-level explanation of what changed — don't dump diffs without summary.

## Finding docs (READ discipline)

`kb_*` tools return a one-line purpose + key exports per file, not raw bytes —
faster and cheaper than raw search. **This fires on the ACTION, not the
intent**: before you `grep`/`rg` for a symbol, `cat`/read a file to learn what
it does, or chase an import, the doc lookup goes first — even mid-task when you
already know the file. When your reflex is the left column, run the right:

| You're about to… | Do this FIRST instead |
|---|---|
| `grep -rn "SymbolName" src/` — find where a fn / type / const lives | `kb_search --doc-type agents "SymbolName"` (or read the nearest directory `AGENTS.md` if kb is not wired) |
| `grep -rn "feature\|topic" src/` — how does X work / where's X handled | `kb_search "feature topic"` (or walk the root→nearest `AGENTS.md` chain) |
| `cat` / read a file just to learn its purpose before editing | `kb agents <path>` — one-line purpose + exports + change history |
| chase imports / callers across files | `kb_neighbors <path\|heading>` |
| read one doc section in full | `kb_get <path> <section>` |

**Fall-through:** if the kb call (or the tree) returns nothing relevant, `rg` /
source read is allowed — then add the missing directory `AGENTS.md` row per the
Documentation Update Protocol. The doc lookup does NOT replace grep; it goes first.

## OpenSpec

This project uses OpenSpec for spec-driven changes. Place change artifacts at
`openspec/changes/<name>/`. Prefer `openspec change new <name>` to scaffold.

When authoring a proposal, add a `## Discipline Skills` line to `proposal.md`
naming the `eng-disciplines` skills its tasks will trigger (mapped via the
checkpoint table below); omit only when none apply. This needs no edit to any
openspec skill — the implement loop reads the proposal artifact unchanged, so
the named skills enter its context and get invoked.

## Discipline Skills

During implementation, invoke the matching `eng-disciplines` skill when a task
signal appears. Skills auto-trigger on natural language, but the implement loop
may never utter the phrase — this table makes the mapping explicit (signals are
observable in the diff / `tasks.md`, not vague intent):

| Task signal (in diff / tasks.md) | Skill |
|---|---|
| touches auth, untrusted input, secrets, webhooks, PII | `security-hardening` |
| spec has a latency/throughput budget, or a large-data / high-traffic path | `performance-optimization` |
| new endpoint, job, external call, or "can't tell what happened in prod" | `observability-instrumentation` |
| non-trivial/irreversible step (migration, public API, cross-boundary) BEFORE it stands | `doubt-driven-review` |
| a bug surfaces mid-implementation | `systematic-debugging` |
| runtime state opaque, `console.log` insufficient | `node-inspect-debugger` |
| feature works + tests pass but the implementation feels heavy | `code-simplification` |

The end gates (`code-review`, `code-quality`) remain unchanged and run at completion before commit.

## Documentation Update Protocol (WRITE discipline)

Per-directory `AGENTS.md` files form a tree. Each directory `AGENTS.md` is the
per-file record for the files in that directory. The ROOT `AGENTS.md` holds
doctrine + architecture pointers only — never a per-file index.

**Keep the root lean.** The root `AGENTS.md` loads into every agent turn — every
byte costs tokens on every turn. A verbose root file buries the rules the model
must follow (signal dilution) and measurably degrades adherence; a lean file
keeps doctrine salient. Default assumption: your update does NOT belong in the
root — route it by the table below.

**Route every doc update by kind:**

| Kind of update | Goes in |
|---|---|
| New file in a directory, or its per-file detail / change history | Nearest directory `AGENTS.md`. Add a `` \| `<basename>` \| <purpose> \| `` row, path-alphabetical. |
| Data flow, protocol, architecture rationale | `docs/architecture.md` or a `docs/<topic>.md` |
| End-user / developer setup | `README.md` |
| Cross-cutting rule every agent needs every turn (rare) | ROOT `AGENTS.md` |

**Read before editing (chain walk).** Before editing a file, read the nearest
`AGENTS.md` chain root→leaf so you know the file's recorded purpose, contracts,
and change history. Do not edit blind.

**Update after editing (closeout pass).** After changing a file, update its row
in the nearest directory `AGENTS.md`: find the file's row, update its purpose in
place; if absent, add it in path-alphabetical order. New directory → scaffold
its `AGENTS.md`. One row per file. The purpose carries a one-line summary, key
exported symbols, contracts/invariants, and `See change: <id>` history.

**Row style (caveman).** Short declarative fragments. Drop articles. Subject →
verb → object, present tense. One fact per row. Prefer concrete tokens (paths,
symbols, env vars) over prose. Keep identifiers verbatim.

**Size rule — split an over-large directory `AGENTS.md` file-based.** pi
auto-injects a directory `AGENTS.md` on every turn when cwd sits at/below it, so
an over-large directory `AGENTS.md` (past a byte cap — typically a flat
directory holding many files) is not supported. Split it file-based: a row
exceeding the length threshold promotes to a per-file `<File>.AGENTS.md`
sidecar carrying that file's full detail (including every `See change:`). The
sidecar is pull-only — its name is not `AGENTS.md`, so pi never auto-injects it
— yet it stays search-indexed (`agents` doc_type). The directory `AGENTS.md`
keeps a one-line summary plus a `→ see \`<File>.AGENTS.md\`` pointer. Rows within
the threshold stay verbatim (lossless).
